## ✨ What is EventVerse?

EventVerse is a production-ready event ticketing platform built to demonstrate end-to-end full-stack engineering — from real-time database reads and authenticated user sessions, to seat map selection, payment checkout, and downloadable PDF tickets.

It's the kind of project that solves a real problem: discovering and booking events is fragmented across a dozen different platforms. EventVerse brings it all into one seamless, modern experience.

## ⚡ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project
- (Optional) A [Stripe](https://stripe.com) account for payment testing

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jayaveer08/eventverse1.git
cd eventverse1
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then fill in your values:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 4. Apply database migrations

In your Supabase dashboard → SQL Editor, run the migration files from `supabase/migrations/` in order.

### 5. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

App runs at **http://localhost:8080** 🚀

## 💳 Test Payment Instructions

EventVerse uses **Stripe in test mode** — no real transactions occur.

Use these credentials at checkout:

```
Card Number : 4242 4242 4242 4242
Expiry      : Any future date (e.g. 12/28)
CVC         : Any 3 digits (e.g. 123)
ZIP         : Any 5 digits (e.g. 10001)
```

You'll receive a booking confirmation and a downloadable PDF ticket immediately after.

---

## 📜 Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev        # Start development server (localhost:8080)
npm run build      # Production build
npm run preview    # Preview production build locally
npm run lint       # Run ESLint across the codebase
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

- **Auth flow** — Supabase Auth handles sessions; protected routes redirect unauthenticated users via React Router guards
- **Data layer** — TanStack Query wraps all Supabase reads/writes for caching, background refetch, and optimistic updates
- **Payments** — Stripe checkout is triggered via a Supabase Edge Function, keeping secret keys server-side and never exposed to the client
- **PDF generation** — Booking confirmations are generated client-side using jsPDF, stamped with event details and a unique booking ID
- **Realtime** — Seat availability updates in real time using Supabase Realtime subscriptions

---

## 🌐 Deployment

This project is deployed on **Vercel** with automatic deployments on every push to `main`.

The `vercel.json` configuration rewrites all routes to `index.html` for correct SPA behavior:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }]
}
```
